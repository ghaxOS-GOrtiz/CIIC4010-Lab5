 Sometimes when you click on an initially white cell, it does not change color.
 Modify the code until it always changes color upon each click, then paste the
 whole MyMouseAdapter class inside the slashes below.
 (Note: This does not apply to cells that are initially gray.)
 Warning: When comparing color objects, make sure to use .equals(...)
 instead of ==. (This is the same as with strings!) For example:
            Color C1 = new Color(0x964B00);   //Brown (simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors)
            Color C2 = new Color(0x964B00);   //Brown (simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors)
            if (C1.equals(C2)) {
                        System.out.println("Yes, they represent the same color.");
            }
            //Note that C1==C2 would be false, because they are different objects.
            
Exercise 3:
Modify the application so that when the user clicks on one of the initially gray cells on the leftmost
column (that is not the top-left cell nor the bottom-left cell), the whole MyMouseAdapter row changes
color randomly so that no cell of that row stays in the same color.
(The leftmost gray cell should stay gray.)
